# Multilingual AI Assistant

## Overview
This is a **Multilingual AI Assistant** built using Streamlit. It allows users to ask questions via voice input, processes the input using an AI model, and responds with both text and speech output.

## Features
- Voice-based input
- AI-powered response generation
- Text-to-speech conversion
- Audio playback of responses
- Option to download the response as an audio file

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd multilingual-ai-assistant
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```
